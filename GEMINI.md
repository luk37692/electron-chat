# Gemini Code Assistant Context

This document provides context for the Gemini code assistant to understand the project structure, dependencies, and conventions.

## Project Overview

This project is a desktop chat application built with Electron, React, and Material-UI. It allows users to chat with a local Ollama instance.

**Key Technologies:**

*   **Electron:** For building the cross-platform desktop application.
*   **React:** For the user interface.
*   **Material-UI:** For UI components.
*   **Webpack:** For bundling the React code.
*   **axios:** For making HTTP requests to the Ollama API.

**Architecture:**

*   **`main.js`:** The main process for the Electron application. It handles window creation, tray integration, and communication with the Ollama API.
*   **`preload.js`:** Exposes specific Node.js and Electron APIs to the renderer process in a secure way.
*   **`renderer.js` and `src/` directory:** The renderer process, which is the React application.
*   **`dist/bundle.js`:** The bundled React application code, generated by Webpack.

## Building and Running

**Development:**

To run the application in development mode with live reloading:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the Webpack development server, which will watch for changes and automatically rebuild the application.

To start the application after building:

```bash
npm start
```

**Production Build:**

To build the application for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create a production-ready bundle in the `dist/` directory.

## Development Conventions

*   **Styling:** The project uses Material-UI for styling. Custom styles are applied using the `sx` prop.
*   **State Management:** The project uses React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`) and custom hooks (`useSettings`, `useChat`) for state management.
*   **API Communication:** The `axios` library is used for communicating with the Ollama API. All API calls are handled in the `main.js` file and exposed to the renderer process via `preload.js`.
*   **File Structure:** The React application is structured with components, hooks, and pages in their respective directories within the `src/` folder.
*   **Linting and Formatting:** There are no explicit linting or formatting rules defined in the `package.json` file. It's recommended to add a linter like ESLint and a formatter like Prettier to maintain code quality.
